How to upload your pages:
1. Create new branch with descriptive name.
2. Upload files (new or modified, git will recognise it).
3. Create a pull request and assign someone (anyone) to review. That will allow us to add some comments etc.
4. Once pull request is confirmed, that branch will be merged into MASTER BRANCH, which is our ultimate branch, where all code is meant to be ready with no errors, so in case something will get messed up we can retrieve kinda "back-up" version.

Ps. Go to little guide https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ to create your own repository, pull request and merge so you can see how that works.
